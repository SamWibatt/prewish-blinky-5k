# prewish-blinky-5k
Same as prewish-blinky, but for the Upduino v2.0 instead of the iceStick.

I expect this to be largely identical to prewish-blinky. It should be the same except for pcf pin assignments, bits for clock dividers, global buffer and oscillator settings, etc. Platform-dependent stuff.
